# Space Tokens
Intended for use with margin, padding, grid gaps, positioning and other layout-related CSS properties. 
A space scale can be defined as either a plain object or an array, but by convention an array is preferred. 
This is an intentional constraint that makes it difficult to add _one-off_ or _in-between_ sizes that could lead to unwanted and rippling affects to layout.
