# Design Principles

#### A set of considerations and philosophies to help us with decision making

### Show, Don’t Tell

Our design system is made to support the way we work—by jumping in and doing, instead of just reading the instructions. We put this into practice by including lots of examples, visuals and any other tools new team members will need to create and contribute as part of our design system. The goal is to get everyone feeling confident about their ability to do the work right away.

### It's Not Complicated

The goal of this project is a lightweight design system that we can use in-house, and that others can build on, too. We’re keeping it light, leaving options open, and sticking to fundamentals in all elements of the design system. That means paring back to what really matters, and relying on our hard-earned expertise in this field.

### It's Gonna Change

And the clients have to be able to change it. This design system isn’t only for us—it’s also for the organizations who need our help. We have to build with their potential needs in mind, and not let our biases creep in wherever possible. The design system should be flexible and extensible so that it can be useful to the broadest number of people.

### It's For Everybody

We want the system to be universal, and consumable by any organization who could benefit from it. That means all the elements should be easy to understand, and geared to practitioners who are not experts, but whose work can benefit from a design system that creates efficiencies, so they can focus on solving bigger business problems.
